My thought process regarding this personal website building is below

I first looked at the basis on how to build a personal website with GitHun pages and all the functions it offers.
I started just creating a website that works with only my name. After this I started working on the internal information.    

I thought and planned carefully on the about me section to get the correct blend between personal information and who I am but keeeping it professional.

When the about me section was completed I updated my CV and LinkedIn profiles and looking on how to add these into my repository in easy to access manners.

The end of the portfolio, I did cleining up and making small presentation and visual changes.
